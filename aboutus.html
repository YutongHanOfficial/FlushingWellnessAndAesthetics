															<p>
																I finished my Medical school in India in 1998. After which I did training in Pediatrics.  Subsequently I moved to the Caribbean in 2000, where I worked as a clinic tutor at St. George’s University from 2000-2002.
                                <br><br>
I started my residency in Combined Internal Medicine and Pediatrics in 2003, and graduated in 2007 at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, MI – where I started as faculty and became associate Program Director and then Program Director until December 2019.
                                <br><br>
Five years ago I started my private practice in Flushing, MI which I bought from Dr. Kinras. I enjoy serving the residents of Genesee County – and helping my patients feel and look their best, so they can live their best lives. I also enjoy giving back to my community by teaching medical students and medical residents.
                                <br><br>
I believe that the most important skills a physician needs is listening skills and being non judgmental. I am here to provide care for the problems patients present, not to judge them! I am also competent in providing care for the LGBTQ community.
                                <br><br>
My motto is providing empathetic, compassionate, competent, non judgmental, confidential care to all of my patients.
